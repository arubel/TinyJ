# TinyJ
The TinyJ language is an extremely small subset of Java. Every valid TinyJ program is a valid Java program, and has the same semantics whether it is regarded as a TinyJ or a Java program. The syntax of TinyJ is given by the following EBNF rules: A Java program is a TinyJ program if and only if it can be generated by these EBNF rules, except that TinyJ doesn’t support method name overloading, program arguments, “return;” statements within the main () method, and ints that are >= 2^31 – 2^16= 2,147,418,112.
